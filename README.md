Abstract—The choice of Activation Functions (AF) has proven
to be an important factor that affects the performance of an
Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Use a 1-hidden layer neural
network model that adapts to the most suitable activation
function according to the data-set. The ANN model can learn for
itself the best AF to use by exploiting a flexible functional form,
k0 + k1 ∗ x with parameters k0, k1 being learned from multiple
runs. You can use this code-base for implementation guidelines
and help.
